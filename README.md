# WT actual F?
## stripped this problem down to the bare bones

I keep getting this message in the console and can't figure out why: 

app.js:1 page refresh
app.js:4 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null
    at app.js:4
(anonymous) @ app.js:4
document.querySelector('#because')
null
